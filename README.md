# Archflow


https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT


## Features
- Stream on the fly an archive from multiple AsyncRead objects.
- Single read / seek free implementation (the CRC and file size are calculated while streaming and are sent afterwards).
- [tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/io/index.html) `AsyncRead` / `AsyncWrite` and `AsyncSeek` compatible. 
- [std::io](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/index.html) `Read` / `Write` and `Seek` compatible

Support the following compression formats:
 - stored (i.e. none)
 - deflate
 - bzip2
 - zstd
 - xz

## Todos

- implement zip64
- implement some zip features (unix time, file comments, ...)
- add more cargo features like for compressors selection

## Examples

- How to create a zip archive
- How to stream an aschive with Hyper
.

 A library for creating ZIP archives in one pass. This is useful when when it is not possible to
 *seek* in the output such as stdout or a data stream.

 ZIP is an archive file format that supports lossless data compression. A ZIP file may contain one
 or more files or directories that may have been compressed. The ZIP file format permits a number
 of compression algorithms, though DEFLATE is the most common. This format was originally created
 in 1989 and was first implemented in PKWARE, Inc.'s PKZIP utility


 The current implementation is based on

 [PKWAREâ€™s APPNOTE.TXT v6.3.10](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT)

 ## Example
 ### [File system](examples/fs.rs)
```rust
 use archflow::{
 archive::FileOptions, compress::tokio::archive::ZipArchive, compression::CompressionMethod,
 error::ArchiveError,
 };

 use tokio::fs::File;

 #[tokio::main]
 async fn main() -> Result<(), ArchiveError> {
 let file = File::create("archive.zip").await?;

 let options = FileOptions::default().compression_method(CompressionMethod::Deflate());

 let mut archive = ZipArchive::new_streamable(file);
 archive.append_file("file1.txt", &mut b"hello\n".as_ref(), &options).await?;

 let options = options.compression_method(CompressionMethod::Store());
 archive.append_file("file2.txt", &mut b"world\n".as_ref(), &options).await?;

 archive.finalize().await?;

 Ok(())
 }
```
